/*

DDL Script: Create Gold Views

Script purpose
  This script creates the view for the Gold Layer in the data warehouse.
  The Gold Layer represents the final dimension and fact tables (star schema)

  Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Silver Layer
  to produce a clean, enriched, and business ready data-set.

Usage:
  These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting
